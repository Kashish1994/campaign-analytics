# Campaign Analytics System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Campaign Analytics System is a high-performance, scalable solution for processing and analyzing ad performance data across multiple platforms. This document provides a summary of the implementation and highlights key architectural decisions.

## Key Components

### API Service (`cmd/api`)

- RESTful API for user interactions
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- Campaign management endpoints
- Analytics query endpoints
- Built with Gin for high performance
- Rate limiting and caching for improved performance

### Worker Service (`cmd/worker`)

- Processes events from Kafka message queue
- Implements idempotent event processing
- Handles data aggregation for analytics
- Runs independently from the API service
- Includes health check endpoint for monitoring

### Data Storage

- **ClickHouse**: Time-series database for analytics data
  - Optimized for high-speed analytical queries
  - Uses materialized views for real-time aggregation
  - Sharded by time for efficient querying

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for metadata
  - Stores user information and campaign details
  - Handles relationships and transactional data

- **Redis**: In-memory cache and utility functions
  - Caches API responses for lower latency
  - Manages deduplication for event processing
  - Provides rate limiting implementation

- **Kafka**: Message queue for event streaming
  - Ensures fault-tolerance and at-least-once delivery
  - Decouples data ingestion from processing
  - Allows independent scaling of components

## Code Organization

The codebase follows a clean architecture approach:

- `cmd/`: Entry points for different services
- `internal/`: Internal packages not meant for external use
  - `api/`: API-specific code (handlers, routes, middlewares)
  - `domain/`: Core business logic and models
  - `infrastructure/`: External integrations (databases, message queues)
  - `config/`: Configuration management
  - `version/`: Version information

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Data Processing**
   - Pre-aggregation of metrics in ClickHouse
   - Materialized views for common query patterns
   - Parallel processing of events

2. **API Performance**
   - Multi-level caching strategy
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Efficient query patterns

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - Connection pooling for databases
   - Goroutines for concurrent operations
   - Efficient memory management

## Scalability Approach

- Horizontal scaling of API and worker services
- Partitioning of Kafka topics for parallel processing
- Sharding of ClickHouse tables for distributed queries
- Stateless service design for easy replication

## Deployment Strategy

- Docker containers for consistent environments
- Kubernetes manifests for orchestration
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring

## Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication
- RBAC for authorization
- Environment-based configuration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Next Steps and Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive tests
2. Implement caching optimizations for hot query patterns
3. Add support for more ad platforms
4. Implement data retention policies
5. Add user-level permissions for multi-tenant support
