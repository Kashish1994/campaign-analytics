# Campaign Budget Tracking API - Solution

This directory contains the solution for the Code Review and Bug Identification assignment. The solution provides a fixed implementation of the campaign budget tracking API, along with detailed explanations of the issues found and their impact.

## Files in this Solution

1. `original_buggy_code.go` - The original buggy implementation (for reference)
2. `fixed_code.go` - The corrected implementation with comments explaining the fixes
3. `README.md` - Detailed analysis of the issues and their impact
4. `SOLUTION.md` - This file, explaining how to use the solution

## Major Issues Fixed

1. Race conditions in concurrent map access
2. Lack of database connection pooling
3. Missing database transaction support
4. Insufficient input validation
5. No record existence checks before updates
6. Inefficient query patterns
7. Poor application lifecycle management

## How to Run the Fixed Code

To run the fixed implementation:

1. Make sure you have Go installed (1.16+ recommended)
2. Set up the required environment variables or use the defaults:
   ```
   export DB_HOST=localhost
   export DB_PORT=5432
   export DB_USER=admin
   export DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   export DB_NAME=zocket
   export DB_SSL_MODE=disable
   ```
3. Build and run the application:
   ```
   go run fixed_code.go
   ```

## API Endpoints

The API exposes the following endpoints:

1. **Update Campaign Spend**
   ```
   POST /campaigns/:campaign_id/spend
   
   Request Body:
   {
     "spend": 100.50
   }
   ```

2. **Get Campaign Budget Status**
   ```
   GET /campaigns/:campaign_id/budget-status
   ```

3. **Health Check**
   ```
   GET /health
   ```

## Key Improvements

- Thread-safe in-memory cache using `sync.Map`
- Proper database connection pooling and configuration
- Transaction support for data consistency
- Comprehensive input validation
- Proper error handling and logging
- Graceful shutdown support
- Structured API responses

## Testing

To test the API, you can use curl or any API testing tool:

```bash
# Update spend
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/campaigns/123/spend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"spend": 50.25}'

# Get budget status
curl http://localhost:8080/campaigns/123/budget-status

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

This implementation significantly improves the reliability, performance, and security of the original code while maintaining the same API contract.
